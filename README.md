### ðŸŒ¾ About Me ðŸŒ¾
Hiii! You can call me Suh, I am currently just a student interested in learning programming and new languages, I study programming at Rocketseat and learn English at Fisk, currently I'm on Fluency 2  and soon I will be finishing my course and I study Japanese and Design by myself.
I'm a quiet person who likes to interact with other people, I usually spend my free time writing some stories, playing games or just listening to a good music while surfing
